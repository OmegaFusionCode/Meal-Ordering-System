# Meal-Ordering-System

This is a code upload of an old project that I completed before I used Git!

This is a web-based system for meal ordering. Customers can place orders and staff can customise the menu. The staff also have access to a prediction system to allow them to predict how many orders each meal would get if a particular menu were to be used.
